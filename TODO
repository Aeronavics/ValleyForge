* The string which yields that white-on-blue text '\E[37;44m'"\033[1m should be replaced with a variable the same as the other colours.

* Add the ATmega328 to the targets list.  Actually, I think I mean the ATmega328, but maybe I don't: I mean whatever the MUX/PPM controller on the ArduPilot Mega is; look this up.  Actually, possibly belay that: the new Arduino's and hence the APMv2 might have a different MCU as the USB interface (and hence the MUX/PPM controller), in which case THAT should be added to the target list instead.

* res/arm should probably be renamed to res/omap, since different ARM processors have quite different peripherals, so 'arm' is not really sufficiently specific.  There are quite a few places this path will need to be updated though?

* Add support to the AVR bootloader makefunction to include the HAL.  Maybe wait until the general AVR makefile has stabilized, then copy it across and modify it for use with the AVR booloader?

* DEFERRED - Add compatibility with existing Arduino compatible projects such as the APM.  Need to have a build configuration which disables the HAL, and instead uses the existing Arduino libraries, which I guess can be in lib somewhere?  Also, need to add support back in for *.cpp extensions, and whatever other extensions the Arduino wants to use.  Also, Arduino projects probably support source in nested folders, which we don't support at the moment?
