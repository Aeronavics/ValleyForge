* The string which yields that white-on-blue text '\E[37;44m'"\033[1m should be replaced with a variable the same as the other colours.

* Add the ATmega328 to the targets list.  Actually, I think I mean the ATmega328, but maybe I don't: I mean whatever the MUX/PPM controller on the ArduPilot Mega is; look this up.

* res/arm should probably be renamed to res/omap, since different ARM processors have quite different peripherals, so 'arm' is not really sufficiently specific.  There are quite a few places this path will need to be updated though?

* Add support to the AVR bootloader makefunction to include the HAL.  Maybe wait until the general AVR makefile has stabilized, then copy it across and modify it for use with the AVR booloader?
