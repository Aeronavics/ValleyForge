* The string which yields that white-on-blue text '\E[37;44m'"\033[1m should be replaced with a variable the same as the other colours.

* Add the ATmega328 to the targets list.  Actually, I think I mean the ATmega328, but maybe I don't: I mean whatever the MUX/PPM controller on the ArduPilot Mega is; look this up.

* All software written with the toolchain should use fixed width data types instead of the default language data types, which have platform dependent widths, eg: use 'uint8_t' instead of 'unsigned char'.  Either we can define our own types in a header file as part of the libary the toolchain provides, or we can use the existing fixed width types; these are provided in a different header file for each compiler (inconveniently), so in this case we'd need to add a '<<<TOOLCHAIN_INSERTS_STDINT_TYPES_HEADER_HERE>>>' macro to the preprocess function.
