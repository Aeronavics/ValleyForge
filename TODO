* The thing that is currently called 'Aspect' is stored in var/config.cfg, making it specific to the user.  I don't think this will neccesarily be that helpful, mostly because one person might be working on different bits of the project.  Get rid of it.

* Change the colour of all the text that is currently dark blue; it is almost impossible to see!

* The string which yields that white-on-blue text '\E[37;44m'"\033[1m should be replaced with a variable the same as the other colours.

* In the 'EDIT' menu, the items "Active Component" and "Another Thing" both have the letter 'A' underlined.
