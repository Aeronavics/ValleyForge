====== Configuration ======

This is a brief guide. More in depth information can be found inside nuttx/configs/README.txt.

Before the [[:NuttX]] source can be built, first a configuration must be loaded. The nuttx/configs directory lists all of the different boards that are available. Inside each of these directories are a number of subdirectories.

  ''<board-name>''
''  |-- README.txt''
''  |-- include/''
''  |   `-- (board-specific header files)''
''  |-- src/''
''  |   |-- Makefile''
''  |   `-- (board-specific source files)''
''  |-- <config1-dir>''
''  |   |-- Make.defs''
''  |   |-- defconfig''
''  |   `-- setenv.sh''
''  |-- <config2-dir>''
''  |   |-- Make.defs''
''  |   |-- defconfig''
''  |   `-- setenv.sh''
''  ...''

The include and src directories are for board specific header and source files respectively. The rest of the subdirectories each contain a particular configuration. The specifics of each configuration are stored inside the README.txt file.

To load a particular configuration, open a terminal window in nuttx/tools and run the following:
'''
configure.sh board-name/config-name
'''
This copies the Make.defs, defconfig and setenv.sh files to the nuttx/ directory, and renames defconfig to ".config".

At this point, NuttX is now in a position to be compiled by calling ''make'' in the nuttx/ directory. Alternatively, further configuration can be done by either manually editing the nuttx/.config file or by running  ''make menuconfig ''in the nuttx/ directory and navigating the various menus.

By default, [[:NuttX]] is not configured to build C++ code, as it requires uClibc++. The reasons for this are related to licensing issues. uClib++ can be installed by following the instructions in misc/uClibc++/README.txt.

===== Modifying the Loaded Configuration =====
Once a particular configuration has been loaded, particular details can be modified by running the following command in the nuttx/ directory:
'''
make menuconfig
'''
This tool uses an ncurses GUI to allow a user to modify all the available configuration settings. This tool requires the kconfig-frontends program to operate. Kconfig-frontends can be found at the following [[http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends|website]] as either a tar ball or git repository.

To install, navigate to the source directory and execute the following commands in order:
'''
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install
'''

By default this installs to /usr/local/bin/
