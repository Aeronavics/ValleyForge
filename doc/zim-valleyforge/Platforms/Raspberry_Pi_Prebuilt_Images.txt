====== Raspberry Pi Prebuilt Images ======

A number of prebuilt images are available for Raspberry Pi targets.

===== Building FS Images =====

In addition to creating the filesystem image, if a folder ''fs_root'' is present in the source folder for the component, then it is assumed to represent elements of a partial root filesystem which should be added to the compoent's filesystem.  This entire folder is copied into the output directory.  However, the contents of this directory are //not// added to the filesystem image: this is a practical consideration, as it's easier to just add these files at the time the image is written to the SD card.
