====== Pixhawk ======
Created Friday 09 January 2015

===== Configuring the Pixhawk Build Environment =====
Instructions for setting up Ubuntu for building the Pixhawk Firmware can be found on the "[[+Build Environment|Build Environment]]" page.

===== Building the Firmware =====
Instructions can be found on the Pixhawk [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/nuttx/building_and_flashing_console|website]].

===== Updating Firmware =====
Firmware is uploaded to the Pixhawk boards via the USB bootloader and a Python uploader script. The specific script that is used can found at Firmware/tools/px_uploader.py. The script is called (Linux) in the following way:
'''
python -u $(UPLOADER) --port $(SERIAL_PORTS) $(BUNDLE)
'''

Where:
* $(UPLOADER) is the path to px_uploader.py
* $(SERIAL_PORTS) is the list of all possible serial ports that the bootloader could be attached to
* $(BUNDLE) is the path to the "firmware.px4" file. For example, "Firmware/Build/px4fmu-v2_default.build/firmware.px4.

Alternatively, one can use the uploader as it is implemented in the Pixhawk build system, as explained [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/nuttx/building_and_flashing_console#flashing_via_usb_with_px4_bootloader|here]].

===== Building the Bootloader =====
Building the bootloader is a simple process.
'''
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Bootloader.git
cd Bootloader
make
'''


===== Updating Bootloader =====
The bootloader can be updated using the JTAG interface and OpenOCD. Instructions can be found [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/px4_bootloader#flashing_bootloader|here]]. Instructions for updating the bootloader using a MicroSD Card or DFUse can be found [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/bootloader_update|here]].
