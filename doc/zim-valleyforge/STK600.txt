====== Programming with the STK600 ======
Created Monday 08 December 2014

The STK600 development platform is used to program AVR chips.

===== Device not programming? Troubleshooting: =====

=== VTarget ===
If the VTARGET LED doesn't light up, then you will need to re-configure the board and set VTARGET back to its appropriate voltage.

**Linux**
1. Run the following command to open it in interactive mode:
	''avrdude -c stk600 -p <part_name> -t''
2. Enter ''vtarg <voltage>'' to change VTarget (eg. "''vtarg 5''")

See this for more information on interactive mode:
http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_8.html

**Windows**
1. Install Atmel Studio 6 (If not already installed)
	AVR Studio does not support the STK600! 
2. Under //Tools// invoke //Device Programming//
3. In the dialog that pops up, select the STK600 as the tool, the correct chip you are using, and ISP as the interface and then click Apply.
4. Go to the //Board Settings// tab, and set VTarget to the appropriate voltage (eg. 5V) and then click write
5. The VTARGET LED should come on and you should be able to program again

Also check that the clock frequency is set right (usually 16MHz)

=== IO Ports ===
The ISP pins are connected to the GPIO headers (eg. PORTD).
If there is anything loading down the ISP pins or shorting them out, the ISP cannot function!
The LEDs aren't a problem though and can be safely connected.
