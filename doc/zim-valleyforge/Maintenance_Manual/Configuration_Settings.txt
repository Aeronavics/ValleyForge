====== Configuration Settings ======

Configuration settings are divided into two categories: build configuration settings, which are defined in the relevant build configuration file for the particular target/platform; and component configuration settings, which are defined in the component configuration file, and may be modified by the user.

However, build configuration settings may also be overridden in the component configuration file when non-standard build settings are required (for example, to pass additional compiler flags).
