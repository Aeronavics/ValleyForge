[[[http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf|Datasheet]]] [[[http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA2560.aspx|Product Page]]]
The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 256KB ISP flash memory, 8KB SRAM, 4KB EEPROM, 86 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, real time counter, six flexible timer/counters with compare modes, PWM, 4 USARTs, byte oriented 2-wire serial interface, 16-channel 10-bit A/D converter, and a JTAG interface for on-chip debugging. The device achieves a throughput of 16 MIPS at 16 MHz and operates between 4.5-5.5 volts.

===== GPIO =====
TODO: Description of ports, pins, and allowable config modes
eg. do the pins support pull-ups? pin-change? interrupts?

===== USART =====
The ATmega2560 has 4 USARTs available (''USART_0 .. USART_3''), and can be configured for Synchronous (SPI-like) and Asynchronous (UART) operating modes, and can also be configured for SPI operation through the SPI HAL module.

For more information see [[HAL:USART]] and [[HAL:USART:AVR]]

===== SPI =====
The ATmega2560 has 1 hardware SPI available (''SPI_0''), and an additional 4 available through the USART peripherals (''USARTSPI_0 .. USARTSPI_3'').

''SPI_0'' can be configured for both Master and Slave SPI, and has four hardware SPI pins that cannot be disabled: MISO, MOSI, SCK, and SS.
''USARTSPI_0..3'' can only be configured for Master SPI and lacks an SS pin.

For more information see [[HAL:SPI]] and [[HAL:SPI:AVR]]

===== I2C =====
TODO: Description of the I2C module and allowable config values

===== CAN =====
This target does not support CAN.
