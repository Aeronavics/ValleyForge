The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 256KB ISP flash memory, 8KB SRAM, 4KB EEPROM, 86 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, real time counter, six flexible timer/counters with compare modes, PWM, 4 USARTs, byte oriented 2-wire serial interface, 16-channel 10-bit A/D converter, and a JTAG interface for on-chip debugging. The device achieves a throughput of 16 MIPS at 16 MHz and operates between 4.5-5.5 volts.

===== GPIO =====
TODO: Description of ports, pins, and allowable config modes
eg. do the pins support pull-ups? pin-change? interrupts?

===== USART =====
The ATmega2560 has 4 USARTs available (''USART_0 .. USART_3''), and can be configured for Synchronous (SPI-like) and Asynchronous (UART) operating modes. For more information see [[HAL:USART]]
These USART channels can also be used as SPI channels through the [[HAL:SPI|SPI HAL module]], but if configured for SPI they cannot be used for UART as well. In this mode it provides proper SPI, which is different to the Synchronous UART mode (although very similar).

The highest supported baud rate for this target is //fclk/K//, where K is 16 for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS, 8 for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_DOUBLESPEED, and 2 for USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_xxx.
For the maximum clock of 16MHz, this is 1Mbps for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS.
For best results, choose a baud rate //fclk/(K*n)// for some //n//. Eg. at 16MHz, supported baud rates are 1M, 6667K, 5000K, 4000Kbaud, etc.
Values that do not satisfy this will be truncated to the nearest integer //n//, and will introduce some error which will be worse for the higher baud rates.
Always verify the USART output matches your configured baud rate with an oscilloscope!!!

You can use the following formula to calculate the error of the chosen baud rate, in percent:
''actual_baud = fclk / (K * (floor(fclk / (K * desired_baud) - 1) + 1))''
''error = ((actual_baud - desired_baud) / desired_baud) * 100''

Supported frame formats:
	5 - 9 data bits
	1 - 2 stop bits

Supported modes:
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS''			- UART
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_DOUBLESPEED''	
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_MASTER''		- Chip drives the XCK pin
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_SLAVE''		- Chip uses the XCK pin for synchronization
	

Supported parity settings:
	''USART_PARITY_NONE''
	''USART_PARITY_EVEN''
	''USART_PARITY_ODD''


===== SPI =====
The ATmega2560 has 1 SPI available (SPI_0), and can be configured for both Master and Slave SPI.
It has four hardware pins: MISO, MOSI, SCK, and SS.
See [[HAL:SPI:AVR]] for more info on target-specific configuration settings.

===== CAN =====
This target does not support CAN.
