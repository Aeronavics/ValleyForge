Created Thursday 04 December 2014

[[[http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf|Datasheet]]] [[[http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATMEGA2560.aspx|Product Page]]]
The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 256KB ISP flash memory, 8KB SRAM, 4KB EEPROM, 86 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, real time counter, six flexible timer/counters with compare modes, PWM, 4 USARTs, byte oriented 2-wire serial interface, 16-channel 10-bit A/D converter, and a JTAG interface for on-chip debugging. The device achieves a throughput of 16 MIPS at 16 MHz and operates between 4.5-5.5 volts.

===== GPIO =====
TODO: Description of ports, pins, and allowable config modes
eg. do the pins support pull-ups? pin-change? interrupts?

===== USART =====
The ATmega2560 has 4 USARTs available (''USART_0 .. USART_3''), and can be configured for Synchronous (SPI-like) and Asynchronous (UART) operating modes. For more information see [[HAL:USART]]
These USART channels can also be used as SPI channels through the [[HAL:SPI|SPI HAL module]], but if configured for SPI they cannot be used for UART as well. In this mode it provides proper SPI, which is different to the Synchronous UART mode (although very similar).

For a 16MHz clock, the baud rate can be configured between (**TODO**) and (**TODO**)

Supported frame formats:
	5 - 9 data bits
	1 - 2 stop bits

Supported modes:
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS''			- UART
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_DOUBLESPEED''	
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_MASTER''		- Chip drives the XCK pin
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_SLAVE''		- Chip uses the XCK pin for synchronization
	

Supported parity settings:
	''USART_PARITY_NONE''
	''USART_PARITY_EVEN''
	''USART_PARITY_ODD''
