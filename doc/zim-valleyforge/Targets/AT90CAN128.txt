====== AT90CAN128 ======
Created Thursday 04 December 2014

[[[http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc7679.pdf|Datasheet]]] [[[http://www.atmel.com/devices/at90can128.aspx|Product Page]]]
The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-basedmicrocontroller combines 128 KB ISP flash memory, 4KB EEPROM, 4KB SRAM, 53 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, CAN controller (V2.0A/V2.0B compliant), real time counter, four flexible timer/counters with compare modes and PWM, two USARTs, byte oriented two-wire serial interface, an 8-channel 10-bit A/D converter with optional differential input stage with programmable gain, programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, SPI serial port, JTAG test interface (IEEE 1149.1 compliant) for on-chip debugging, and five software selectable power saving modes. The device supports a throughput of 16 MIPS at 16 MHz and operates between 2.7-5.5 volts.

===== GPIO =====
TODO: Description of ports, pins, and allowable config modes
eg. do the pins support pull-ups? pin-change? interrupts?

===== USART =====
The ATmega2560 has 2 USARTs available (''USART_0'' and ''USART_1''), and can be configured for Synchronous (SPI-like) and Asynchronous (UART) operating modes. For more information see [[HAL:USART]]

For more information see [[HAL:USART]] and [[HAL:USART:AVR]]

===== SPI =====
The ATmega2560 has 1 SPI available (SPI_0), and can be configured for both Master and Slave SPI.
It has four hardware pins that cannot be disabled: MISO, MOSI, SCK, and SS.

For more information see [[HAL:SPI]] and [[HAL:SPI:AVR]]
