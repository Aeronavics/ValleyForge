====== Arduino ======
Created Thursday 04 December 2014

Properly speaking, the term Arduino does not describe a particular architecture, but a broader category of targets, which support being programmed using the 'Wiring'-based Arduino IDE. Arduino devices are typically based on AVR or ARM Cortrex-M micro-controllers. Software developed using the Arduino IDE is similar to C++, but not entirely interchangeable, which means that the normal build system provided by the toolchain is unable to compile this software, even if the toolchain nominally supports the target hardware.

For instance, the ArduPilot?-Mega v2.5 is based upon the AVR ATmega2560, a target which the toolchain supports. However, the official ArduPilot software cannot be compiled using the [[ATmega2560|ATmega2560 target]] using the toolchain, because the software does not comply with the toolchain's dependency detection requirements, nor even constitute valid C++ code (without the Arduino build system's preprocessing).

Because users of the toolchain may wish to make use of Arduino devices and software as part of a project, the toolchain provides a separate architecture class and targets for Arduino programming. Components using an Arduino based target configuration have different requirements for source files (see [[Programming Languages]]) and configuration settings, than for a component which selects the target configuration of the micro-controller on which the Arduino hardware is actually based. For example: the targets ArduPilotMega and ATmega2560 are not interchangeable.
