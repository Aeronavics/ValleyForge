====== HAL ======

The Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) is a collection of modules which can be used to communicate with various hardware peripherals for various supported [[Targets|targets]]. The goal of the HAL is to make using hardware-specific peripherals easy, and portable across different targets with minimal modification.

===== Modules =====
The HAL modules are documented in the links below, but for complete interface documentation see their respective .hpp headers, which can be found under //res/common/hal///

	[[+GPIO|GPIO]] - General Purpose IO
	Watchdog
	EEPROM - Integrated non-volatile memory
	[[+USART|USART]] - Asynchronous & Synchronous USART interface
	CAN - Controller Area Network
	I2C - Inter-Integrated Circuit (Also known as TWI)
	[[+SPI|SPI]] - Serial Peripheral Interface
	ADC - Analog to Digital Converter
	Timer/Counter
	
===== Other Info =====
	[[HAL:Callbacks|Callbacks]] - How the HAL manages callbacks for interrupts and asynchronous communications


===== Support =====
The HAL is still a work-in-progress. The table below shows which HAL modules are implemented for each supported target.
