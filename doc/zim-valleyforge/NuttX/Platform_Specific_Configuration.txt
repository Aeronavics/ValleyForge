====== Platform Specific Configuration ======

For each application, [[NuttX]] requires two values to be defined: the stack size and the priority.

Inside the component .cfg file there are four additional keys:
* APP_STACKSIZES
	 This is a space delimited string of the stack sizes for each application defined in EXECUTABLES. If EXECUTABLES is not defined, then only one stack size should be entered.
* DEFAULT_APP_STACKSIZE
	This is the stack size that will be applied to an application in the instance that one is not defined in APP_STACKSIZES. At the time of writing, this is automatically assigned a value of 2048.
* APP_PRIORITIES
	As with APP_STACKSIZES, APP_PRIORITIES is a space delimited string of priorities for each application defined in EXECUTABLES. If EXECUTABLES is not defined, then only one priority value should be entered.
* DEFAULT_APP_PRIORITY
	This is the priority that will be automatically assigned to an application should one not be defined in APP_PRIORITIES. At the time of writing, this is automatically assigned the value of "SCHED_PRIORITY_DEFAULT".
