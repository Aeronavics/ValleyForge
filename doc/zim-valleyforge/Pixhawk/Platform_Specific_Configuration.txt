====== Platform Specific Configuration ======

Since Pixhawk is built on top of NuttX, it also requires some additional configuration. Specifically, each executable requires a stacksize, or for there to be a default stacksize defined.

Inside the component .cfg file, there are two additional keys. 
* APP_STACKSIZES
	 This is a space delimited string of the stack sizes for each application defined in EXECUTABLES. If EXECUTABLES is not defined, then only one stack size should be entered.
* DEFAULT_APP_STACKSIZE
	This is the stack size that will be applied to an application in the instance that one is not defined in APP_STACKSIZES. At the time of writing, this is automatically assigned a value of 2048.
