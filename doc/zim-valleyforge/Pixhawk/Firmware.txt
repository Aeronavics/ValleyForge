====== Firmware ======

===== Building the Firmware =====
Instructions can be found on the Pixhawk [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/nuttx/building_and_flashing_console|website]].

===== Updating Firmware =====
Firmware is uploaded to the Pixhawk boards via the USB bootloader and a Python uploader script. The specific script that is used can found at Firmware/tools/px_uploader.py. The script is called (Linux) in the following way:
'''
python -u $(UPLOADER) --port $(SERIAL_PORTS) $(BUNDLE)
'''

Where:
* $(UPLOADER) is the path to px_uploader.py
* $(SERIAL_PORTS) is the list of all possible serial ports that the bootloader could be attached to
* $(BUNDLE) is the path to the "firmware.px4" file. For example, "Firmware/Build/px4fmu-v2_default.build/firmware.px4.

Alternatively, one can use the uploader as it is implemented in the Pixhawk build system, as explained [[https://pixhawk.org/dev/nuttx/building_and_flashing_console#flashing_via_usb_with_px4_bootloader|here]].
