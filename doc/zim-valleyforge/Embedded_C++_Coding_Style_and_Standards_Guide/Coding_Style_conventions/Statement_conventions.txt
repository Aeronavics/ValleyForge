====== Statement conventions ======

===== Including Files =====
51. **Include statements should be sorted and grouped:**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
// INCLUDE REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES.

// Include system dependencies.
#include <stdio>
#include <stdlib>

// Include the 'some' package.
#include "some/file.hpp"
#include "some/other_file.hpp"
}}}


Include statements should be sorted such that the lowest level dependencies are included first. Include statements for related dependencies should be grouped together, separated by a single blank line.


52. **Include statements should always use relative path-names. Absolute path-names are not allowed.**


53. **Include statements must always appear at the top of the file.**


===== Flow Control Statements =====
54. **Flow control statements (if, for, while, switch and do) should be followed by a block, even if the block is empty:**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
while (something)
{
	// Do nothing.
}
}}}


An empty block should be explained by a comment, to indicate that this expected.


55. **Only loop control statements must be included in the for() construction.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
sum = 0;						// NOT: for (i = 0, sum = 0; i < 100; i++)
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)		//		{
{								//			sum += value[i];
	sum += value[i];			//		}
}
}}}


This increases maintainability and readability. It is also helpful to make a clear distinction of what controls and what is contained in the loop.


56. **Loop variables should be initialized immediately before the loop.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
is_done = false;			// NOT: bool is_done = false;
while (!is_done)			// ...
{							// while (!is_done)
...							// {
}							//		...
							// }
}}}



57. **The form while (true) should be used for infinite loops.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
while (true)
{
	...
}

for (;;)		// NO!
{
	...
}

while (1)		// NO!
{
	...
}
}}}


Testing against 1 is neither necessary nor meaningful. The form ''for (;;)'' is not very readable and is not apparent that this actually is an infinite loop.
	

===== Constants =====
58. **Numeric values in code will not be used; symbolic values will be used instead.** 
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
class A
{
	A()
	{
		coefficient[0] = 1.23; 	// Good
		coefficient[1] = 2.34; 	// Good
		coefficient[2] = 3.45; 	// Good
	}
	private:
		float64 coefficient[3]; // Cannot be initialized via the member initialization list.
};

}}}


This is to improve readability and maintenance. Note that an exception is when a class/structure constructor initializes an array member with numeric values.
**Note:** In many cases ‘0’ and ‘1’ are not magic numbers but are part of the fundamental logic of the code (e.g. ‘0’ often represents a NULL pointer). In such cases, ‘0’ and ‘1’ may be used. 


59. **Floating point constants should always be written with decimal point and at least one decimal.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
double total = 0.0;		// NOT: double total = 0;
double speed = 3.0e8;	// NOT: double speed = 3e8;
}}}


This emphasizes the different nature of integer and floating point numbers. Mathematically the two model completely different and non-compatible concepts.


60. **Floating point constants should always be written with a digit before the decimal point.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
double total = 0.5;		// NOT: double total = .5;
}}}


The number and expression system in C++ is borrowed from mathematics and one should adhere to mathematical conventions for syntax wherever possible. Also, 0.5 is a lot more readable than .5; There is no way it can be mixed with the integer 5.


61. **When comparing with constants, the constant should be the second operand.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
if (i == 5)		// NOT: if (5 == i)
}}}



===== Variables =====
62. **Multiple variable declarations shall not be allowed on the same line.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
int32* p,q;									// Probably error.
int32 first_button_on_top, i;				// Bad: easy to overlook 'i'.
}}}



===== Conditionals =====
63. **Complex conditional expressions must be avoided. Introduce temporary Boolean variables instead.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
bool is_finsished = (element_no < 0) || (element_no > max_element);
bool is_repeated_entry = element_no == last_element;
if (is_finished || is_repeated_entry)
{
	...
}

// NOT:
if (element_no < 0) || (element_no > max_element) ||
	element_no == last_element)
{
	...
}
}}}


By assigning Boolean variables to expressions, the program gets automatic documentation. The construction will be easier to read, debug and maintain.


64. **When assigning to bool variables, the logical expression should be parenthesized.**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
bool b = (i > j);
}}}



65. **Do not compare bool variables and expressions to true or false; use the value of bool or its negated value:**
{{{code: lang="cpp" linenumbers="true"
bool b = true;
if (b)		// NOT: if (b == true)
{
	...
}

if (!b)		// NOT: if (b == false)
{
	...
}
}}}
