====== General Design ======

In general, the code produced should exhibit the following important qualities: 

* **Reliability:** Executable code should consistently fulfill all requirements in a predictable manner. 

* **Portability:** Source code should be portable (i.e. not compiler or linker dependent).

* **Maintainability:** Source code should be written in a manner that is consistent, readable, simple in design, and easy to debug.

* **Testability:** Source code should be written to facilitate testability. Minimizing the following characteristics for each software module will facilitate a more testable and maintainable module:
	1. code size
	2. complexity
	3. static path count (number of paths through a piece of code)

* **Reusability:** The design of reusable components is encouraged. Component reuse can eliminate redundant development and test activities (i.e. reduce costs).

* **Extensibility:** Requirements are expected to evolve over the life of a product. Thus, a system should be developed in an extensible manner (i.e. perturbations in requirements may be managed through local extensions rather than wholesale modifications).

* **Readability:** Source code should be written in a manner that is easy to read, understand and comprehend.

Adherence to these guidelines, will help programmers produce clean designs that minimize common sources of mistakes and errors.
