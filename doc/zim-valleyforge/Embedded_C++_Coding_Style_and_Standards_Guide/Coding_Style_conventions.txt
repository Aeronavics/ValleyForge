====== Coding Style conventions ======

The intent of the style guide is to establish a "**style baseline**" that all developers are required to follow. This baseline provides a consistence across the source code files that aids in reading/maintain the code. In addition, following a common programming style will enable the construction of tools that incorporate knowledge of these standards to help in the development and maintenance of the code.

This guide specifies only basic requirements â€” the individual programmer is allowed to impose his/her own style/preferences on top of these requirements. There are only **two absolute rules** to observe when it comes to "creating your own" coding style. 

**Consistency - **//Establish a style and stick to it.//

**Tolerance - **//When you must modify code written by others, conforming to a different style, adopt that style, do not convert the code to your style.//
