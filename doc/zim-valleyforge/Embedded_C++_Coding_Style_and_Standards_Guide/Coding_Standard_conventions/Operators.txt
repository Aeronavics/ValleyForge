====== Operators ======

**Operators || , &&  and unary &  shall not be overloaded.**

First the behaviour of the || and && operators depend on short-circuit evaluation of the operands. However, short-circuit evaluation is not possible for overloaded versions of the ''||''  and ''&&''  operators. Hence, overloading these operators may produce unexpected results.

Next, if the address of an object of incomplete class type is taken, but the complete form of the type declares operator ''&()'' as a member function, the resulting behaviour is undefined.
