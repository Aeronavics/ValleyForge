====== Targets ======
Created Wednesday 03 December 2014

[[ValleyForge]] supports a number of different microprocessor hardwares or 'targets'. Support for further targets can be added as demand dictates.
Currently supported targets are listed below, grouped by architecture type.

===== AVR =====
	AVR is a ubiquitous 8-bit microcontroller architecture developed and used by Atmel.
	* [[+ATmega2560|ATmega2560]]
	* [[+ATmega64C1|ATmega64M1 / ATmega64C1]]
	* [[+AT90CAN128|AT90CAN128]]

===== Arduino =====
	Arduino is a popular framework used widely amongst hobbyists, and uses a C++-like language which must be compiled in a non-standard way. See the [[Targets:Arduino|Arduino]] page for more information.
	* [[+ArduPilotMega|ArduPilotMega]] - Based on the ATmega2560, but cannot be compiled using the ATmega2560 target.

===== AVR32 =====
	AVR32 is a 32-bit architecture developed by Ateml.
