====== AVR ======
Created Friday 12 December 2014

Most AVR chips have at least one hardware USART peripheral, configurable for both Asynchronous (UART) and Synchronous (SPI-Like) communication.

Note that the following information does not apply to the [[Targets:ATmega64C1|ATmega64C1 family]] of chips as they use the LIN peripheral instead.

=== Baud Rate ===
The highest supported baud rate is //fclk/K//, where K is 16 for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS, 8 for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_DOUBLESPEED, and 2 for USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_xxx.
For a CPU clock of 16MHz, this is 1Mbps for USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS.
For best results, choose a baud rate //fclk/(K*n)// for some n â‰¤ 4095. Eg. at 16MHz, supported baud rates are 1M, 6667K, 5000K, 4000Kbps, etc.
Values that do not satisfy this will be truncated to the nearest integer //n//, and will introduce some error which will be worse for the higher baud rates.
Always verify the USART output matches your configured baud rate with an oscilloscope!!!

=== Baud Error ===
You can use the following formula to calculate the error of the chosen baud rate, in percent:
''actual_baud = fclk / (K * (floor(fclk / (K * desired_baud) - 1) + 1))''
''error = ((actual_baud - desired_baud) / desired_baud) * 100''

=== Configuration Options ===
Supported frame formats:
	5 - 9 data bits
	1 - 2 stop bits

Supported modes:
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS''			- UART
	''USART_MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS_DOUBLESPEED''	
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_MASTER''		- Chip drives the XCK pin
	''USART_MODE_SYNCHRONOUS_SLAVE''		- Chip uses the XCK pin for synchronization
	
Supported parity settings:
	''USART_PARITY_NONE''
	''USART_PARITY_EVEN''
	''USART_PARITY_ODD''
