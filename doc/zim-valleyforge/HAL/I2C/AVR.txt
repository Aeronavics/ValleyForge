====== AVR Module Usage Notes ======
Created Thursday 04 February 2016

All AVR processors use the same I2C hardware and are identical in use.

===== Missed start problem =====
There is a bug in the I2C hardware that causes the hardware to miss a start condition when processing a stop as slave receiver if operated in a multimaster setup. If the I2C interface is also being used as master and a master operation is waiting to start it will send a start condition when able. If a preceding start condition has been missed and the bus is in use by another master the start will be transmit in an illegal position causing a bus error and potentially causing the bus to lockup. To prevent this ensure that there is a delay of at least 15us between the stop being transmitted to the AVR slave on the bus and the next start.
