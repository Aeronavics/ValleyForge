Summaries of the Timer/ Counter units to each target board can be found in the links below:

	(Link to each target device summary)

The mode of operation/ behaviour of the Timer/ Counter and the output compare pins, is defined by the combination of the waveform generation mode (WGM02:0) and compare output mode [[(COMnx1:0)]] bits.

The wavefrom generation mode bitts affect the counting sequence of the Timer/ Counter. Whereas the COM1:0 bits control whether the PWM output generated should be inverted or not.

For non PWM modes the COMnx1:0 bits control whether the output should be set, cleared, or toggled at a compare match. 

== Initialisation ==

Functions are designed to return an acknowledgement or a negative-acknowledgement depending on the validity of the user's use of each function. Therefore, a boolean variable can be used to confirm each process has indeed been processesed without error. This is entirely optional, and the two examples show each method.

== Example ==

	‭''thasidoh ;asd fkasj;dl fisadj; fkljasd;lfjlasdk;j flk;asdjfkl;sjdkajs;dlk j;as''
	
	

	''Tc timer0_pre1(TC_0);		// Creates an Instance of Timer/ Counter 0''
	''Tc_rate timer0_rate;''
	''timer0_rate.pre = TC_PRE_1;''
	''timer0_rate.src = TC_SRC_INT;''
	
	''timer0_pre1.initialise();''
	''timer0_pre1.set_rate(timer0_rate);''


=== Prescalar ===
All synchronous Timer/ Counters share the same prescaler module, but the Timer/Counters can ahve different prescaler settings. The prescaled clock has a frequency  of either {{./equation.png?type=equation}},  {{./equation001.png?type=equation}}, {{./equation002.png?type=equation}}, {{./equation003.png?type=equation}}.

Also, prescale of 1 can be given to operate at the clock frequency equal to system clock frequency.

=== Setting the mode ===

This is the grunt of the timer/ counter code. Each timer and counter can be given a range of different operating modes. The list of operating modes can be seen here

[ add wave generation modes ]

Within each wave generation mode, there are also channel modes to configure the pin behaviour of the timer/counter.
