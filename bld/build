Parameters:

Options:
	-h --help			Show this message.

	-r --retain			Retain temporary files at completion of script.
	-b --bootloader			Build the bootloader for each component as well.

	-n --name <Component Name>	Specify the name of a component to build.
	-p --postpack			Pack up the compilers used after the build (takes longer next time).
