Usage: $0 [Options] [File Name]

This script is used, as part of the 'Valley Forge' Embedded Toolchain to create empty source files to develop with.

Parameters:

	[File Name]			Specify the name of the files to add to the current project.

Options:
	-h --help			Show this message.
	-b --batch			Operate in 'batch mode', wherein there are no interactive prompts.
	-n --name <File Name>		Specify the name of the files to add to the current project.
	-c --component			Specify the name of the component to add the files to.  Defaults to the 'active component'.
	-t --type <File Type>		Specify the kind of files to create (either 'C' or 'CPP').
	-p --platform			Specify the platform for which the files will be created (BareMetal/freertos)
EOF
	# All done.
