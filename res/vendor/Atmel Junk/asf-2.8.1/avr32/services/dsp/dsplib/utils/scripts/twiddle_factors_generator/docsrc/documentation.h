 * \ingroup group_dsplib_tools
 * \brief This script generates a table of twiddle factors you can directly use with the complex FFT functions.
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 * This script runs with Scilab (http://www.scilab.org/), Scilab is the free software for numerical computation.\n
 * The following variables can be modified in the script:
 * - \b N_TWIDDLE_FACTORS: to specify the maximum length of the FFT you want to use with this table.
 * - \b BITS: the number of bits of a data (16 or 32).
