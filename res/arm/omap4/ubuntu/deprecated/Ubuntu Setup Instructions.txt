*************************************************************/

1 -	(Note: This step details the manual method for extracting an image to a device,
	for a simpler process please use the sdCardInstall bash file) 	
	Place Ubuntu installation image on SD-Card. Insert SD-Card into host PC and
	navigate to folder containing image whilst in a Terminal.
	After ensuring SD-Card is unmounted from system execute the following:
	i.  gunzip <name of image>.img.gz
	ii. sudo dd bs=4M if=<name of image>.img 
	    of=/dev/sd<letter attached to SD-Card>
	iii.sync
	
	NB: the letter attached to the SD-Card can be found by entering 'df -h' into a 		terminal window when the device is mounted.

2 - 	Insert the SD-Card into the Pandaboard slot, boot up and follow the setup 
	instructions on-screen.

3 - 	Edit /etc/apt/sources.list to enable the universe and multiverse repositories 
	required for installing the proprietary omap4-extras. The following lines will 		need to be added to the file:
	
	deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric universe multiverse
	deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric universe multiverse

	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric universe
	deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric universe
	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates universe
	deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hardy-updates universe

	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric multiverse
	deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric multiverse
	deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates multiverse
	deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ oneiric-updates multiverse

	deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric-security universe
	deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric-security universe
	deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric-security multiverse
	deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu oneiric-security multiverse

4 - 	After attaching an ethernet connection to the Pandaboard, execute the following
	commands to update the repository list and install the OMAP4 development PPA:
	i.   sudo apt-get instll python-software-properties
	ii.  sudo apt-get-repository ppa:tiomap-dev/release
	iii. sudo apt-get update
	iv.  sudo apt-get install ubuntu-omap4-extras

5 - 	Install byobu and set to run at every login by entering the following commands:
	i.  sudo apt-get install byobu
	ii. byobu-enable

6 - 	Enable colours at the terminal prompt by editing the hidden .bashrc folder.
	The following commands may be of use:
	i.  cd ~
	ii. sudo nano .bashrc

	The line '#force_colour_prompt=yes' should be un-commented.

7 - 	Uninstall any applications that are not going to be needed.

8 - 	Disable all tty terminals other than TTY1 with the following commands:
	i.  sudo mv /etc/init/tty<#>.conf /etc/init/tty<#>.conf.disabled

	Where # is the tty number to be disabled.
	A complete listing of all tty terminals can be found by looking in the 
	/etc/init folder.

9 - 	Disable the desktop graphical display for efficiency. This is 'lightdm' in Ubuntu 		11.10+. This can be done by entering the following:
	i.  sudo mv /etc/init/lightdm.conf /etc/init/lightdm.conf.disabled

10 - 	Enter the USB drive into the /etc/fstab listing by adding the following entry:
	"UUID=<UUID> /mnt/usb vfat defaults,users,uid=<UID>,gid=<GID>,umask=007 0 0"

	Where: UUID is replaced by the UUID found using 'sudo blkid'.
	       UID is replaced by the user ID found using 'id -u <username>'
	       GID is replaced by the group ID found using 'id -g <username>'

11 - 	Enable Numlock at the tty's by default.

	Add the following to "/etc/rc.local"

	# Turn Numlock on for the TTYs:
	for tty in /dev/tty[1-6]; do
	    /usr/bin/setleds -D +num < $tty
	done

12 -    Install wicd network manager on the system. Use the following commands:
	i.  sudo apt-get install wicd
	ii. sudo apt-get install wicd-curses	(<-- May be required to ensure wicd-curses 
							is installed)

13 - 	Uninstall Network-Manager with the following:
	i.  sudo apt-get remove network-manager

14 - 	Disable the boot splash screen to speed up booting time and allow kernel messages
	to be shown during the boot process.
	i.  Edit "/boot/boot.script" to remove "quiet splash".
	ii. sudo update-initramfs -u

15 - 	Install the Open SSH Server application to allow SSH access.
	i. sudo apt-get install openssh-server

16 -	<Optional>
	Configure WiFi access with wicd-curses with the following steps:
	i.  wicd-curses
	ii. Search for desired network and edit the configurations by pressing the right 	     key.
	iii.For UCwireless, settings that were found to work included the following:
	    'Use Encryption' selected
	    Encryption type: PEAP with TKIP/MSCHAPv2
